# GovTracker-frontend

GovTracker is a website aimed at tracking each party's platform, and then tracking their record while they are in office.  GovTracker's goal is to bring transparency to Canadian politics so we can hold our elected officials responsible for their actions.

## About this repo

This GitHub repo will hold the front-end code for GovTracker.  The front-end technology stack is as follows:

* React for composing pages
* Redux for handling state
* React-router for handling URL routing
* Node.js for server-side rendering
* Babel for JavaScript compilation and polyfills
* Bootstrap for templating
* Font-Awesome for icons
* Other components as required.

### Note about discussions

Political discussions of any nature will not be tolerated here.  Use of this GitHub repo to discuss the code and track bugs is actively encouraged.  However, any discussion outside of that is not allowed here.  Leave the actual discussion about platforms for the actual GovTracker website.  Partisan discussions do not have their place here, nor on GovTracker.  Just the facts.
